As of 0.2.5x, <a href="https://github.com/blackbaud-community/stache" target="_blank">'Stache</a> is now powered with the goodness of blogs.  Blogs introduce two new YAML Front Matter variables to tell 'Stache to layout your markdown into the blog pattern.  `layout: layout-blog-post` is used for individual blog posts while `layout: layout-blog` is used for the parent blog page.  For more details, see our [Blog pattern]({{stache.config.pattern_blog}}). 

You will need to [Upgrade 'Stache]({{stache.config.docs_getting_started}}#upgrading-stache) for each of your local 'Stache sites.  

If you wish to see a working sample in action, you should [get the latest boilerplate]({{stache.config.docs_getting_started}}#getting-the-latest-boilerplate) and create a new test website with the <code><a href="{{stache.config.docs_stache_commands}}#stache-new">stache new</a></code> command.
